## Prateek: Efficient Terrain Storage
Creating the Chunk Object
- Creating the Chunk object was fairly straightforward. I changed the shader program code to accept only one VBO including the position, normal and color for all vertices.
VBO data for hull of Chunk
- I decided to move the createPosNorCol() function from Chunk to Terrain, since I needed access to the QHash map for checking blocks across the intersection of two chunks. The updateScene() function is to be called every time the block structure is updated (block added/removed, new terrain generated). This way the VBOs are only getting populated when the terrain changes rather than at every update().
Storing Chunk in QHash
- Using the example code provided on Piazza for bit manipulations, it was simple to convert an x and z coordinate to a int64_t for the QHash.
